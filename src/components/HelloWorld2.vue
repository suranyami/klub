      <h1>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</h1>
      <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>
      <p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? <strong> It's art!</strong> <em> A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?</em> '!</p>

      <p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</li><li>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</li><li>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</li>

      <h3>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</h3>
      <p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>

      <p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You've swallowed a planet!</p>
      <p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Saving the world with meals on wheels. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</p>

      <p>You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>
      <p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!</p>

      <p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</p>
      <p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You've swallowed a planet! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>
